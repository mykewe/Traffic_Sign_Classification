# Traffic_Sign_Classification
In this project, we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build, train, and test a traffic sign classification model. We will be implementing this model using TensorFlow and Keras, which are both open-source machine learning libraries. The task at hand is a multiclass classification problem, meaning that we will be classifying traffic signs into multiple classes or categories. The goal of this model is to be able to accurately recognize and classify traffic signs, which can then be used in applications such as making cars smarter and more aware of their surroundings. This could potentially improve road safety by enabling cars to make better decisions based on the traffic signs they are able to recognize. Additionally, this model could also be used in other areas such as traffic management and autonomous driving.
